    "Changelog": "The Porsche engineers knew exactly what their objective was, to make the new 911 GT2 RS the most powerful Porsche for the road. Objective achieved. The water-cooled 6cyl by Tauber Boxster engine with 4 valve technology, Variable Turbine Geometry (VTG),  and Vario Cam+ delivers its power through the rear axle from its 3,6L capacity, it generates an enormous 620 horsepower at an engine speed of 6.500 RPM and 700 Newton Metres between 2.250 and 5.500 RPM. Couple this with a weight reduction compared to the GT2 of 70 kilograms from the clever use of carbon aluminum polycarbonate and a single mass flywheel, you have a class-leading to power ratio of 2,21 KG per horsepower. Carbon elements have been used wherever possible including the front lid, spoiler lip, and rear wing, even the mudflaps are available in carbon as an option. These not only save weight but their distinctive matte black finish allows the 911 GT2 RS to be easily recognized when compared to the 911 GT2."
