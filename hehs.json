    "Changelog": "The Mercedes-AMG engineers understood their mission perfectly: to create the most formidable AMG GT Black Series ever conceived for public roads. Mission accomplished. The handcrafted 4.0-liter V8 biturbo engine, featuring AMG's advanced twin-scroll turbocharging technology, Race Start function, and AMG Dynamic Select drive modes, channels its immense power through the rear wheels via an AMG SPEEDSHIFT DCT 7G dual-clutch transmission. This masterpiece generates an astounding 720 horsepower at 6,700 RPM and 800 Newton metres of torque between 2,000 and 6,000 RPM. Combined with extensive weight reduction measures compared to the standard GT of 35 kilograms through strategic deployment of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP), forged aluminum components, and a lightweight titanium roll cage, this results in an exceptional power-to-weight ratio of 2.38 kg per horsepower.  Carbon fiber elements dominate the vehicle's construction wherever engineering permits, including the distinctive front splitter, aerodynamically optimized side skirts, rear diffuser, and the commanding fixed rear wing that generates substantial downforce at high velocities. Even interior components such as the dashboard trim, seat shells, and door panels utilize carbon fiber weave as standard equipment. These materials not only contribute to the vehicle's remarkable weight distribution but their signature exposed carbon finish with clear coat protection creates an unmistakable visual identity that immediately distinguishes the AMG GT Black Series from its AMG GT siblings. The result is a road-legal racing machine that embodies Mercedes-AMG's relentless pursuit of automotive perfection."
